% Polynomial Division Template

function [q,r] = Polynomial_Division_Template(b,a)
% Here we create the function fandle named "Polynomial_Division_Template"

n = length (b)-1; 
m = length (a) -1;
% Now we assign the variables n and m the length of a and b (which are our parameters)

if m > n 
    % If statement for when m is greater than n, then no quotient and n is the remainder
   q=0; 
   r = b;
    return; 
end

a = [a,zeros(1, n-m)];
q = 0;

% Now we need to obtain the quotient and remainder by doing the division
for k= 1:n+1
    % for loop that runs from 1 to n+1
    if k < n-m+2
        q(k)=(b(k)-[q(1:k-1)]*[a(k:-1:2)].')/a(1);
        % This is the equation if k is bigger than n-m+2
    else
        r(k-(n-m+1))=b(k)-[q(1:n-m+1)]*[a(k: -1:k-n+m)].';
        % This is the equation if k is less than n-m+2
    end 
    % For if statement
end 
%For for loop

end
