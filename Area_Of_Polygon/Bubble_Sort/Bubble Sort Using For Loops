%BUBBLE SORT - ASSIGNMENT 1

clc,clear,close all

%There are going to be 10 numbers in the vector
A=randi(100,1,n)
%make the vector numbers from 1-10
%This will show the vector not sorted

%size of vector


for i=1:n-1
    %pass through vector n-1 times
    for j=1:n-1
        %look at j element and bubble thorugh vector comparing each number
        %with the next and swap
       if (A(j)>A(j+1))

           %from lines 13-15 is a swap function

%To show the newly arranged vector
